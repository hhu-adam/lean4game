# Syntax
Inside strings, you need to escape backslashes, but not inside doc-strings, therefore you
  would write `Introduction "some latex here: $\\iff$."` but
  `/-- some latex here: $\iff$. -/ Statement ...`

# Support
It is important to mention that KateX supports most but not all of latex and its packages.
See [supported](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html).
